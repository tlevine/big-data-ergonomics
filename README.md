Big Data Ergonomics
===================

## Proof of concept

For my first endeavour into big data ergonomics, I conduct a particularly
minimal experiment to demonstrate the concept of big data ergonomics.

## Variable selection

Given the definition of ergonomics put forth by the International Ergonomics Association,
I decided to select at least one productivity variable, at least one well-being
variable and at least one intervention. Given Jack's design-program-exposure
taxonomy, it might make sense to select three interventions, but I wanted to
go with something minimal so I actually finish it.

In order to collect big ergonomics data easily, I chose variables that would be
inexpensive and easy to collect with computer sensors. With this in mind, the
intervention would need to be a design or exposure intervention, not a program
intervention. I went with these variables.

In order to demonstrate the value of big data ergonomics, I chose a concern
that would be difficult to evaluate with small data. I looked at an issue
relating to static loading because such analysis involves estimation of variances,
which demands larger samples than estimation of means. I looked at very longitudinal
data (measurements each second for a person) because such data beg to be modeled
in a non-aggregated way with "machine-learning" techniques rather being aggregated
for traditional "statistics" (not that machine learning and statistics are
different).

*Productivity*: Times of key presses

*Well-being*: 

*Intervention*: Keyboard weight
