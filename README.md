Big Data Ergonomics
===================

For my first endeavour into big data ergonomics, I conduct a particularly
minimal experiment to demonstrate the concept of big data ergonomics. I
decided to select at least one productivity variable, at least one well-being
variable and at least one intervention. Given Jack's design-program-exposure
taxonomy, it might make sense to select three interventions, but I wanted to
go with something minimal so I actually finish it.
